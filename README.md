# PythonSlowSnakeGame
Turn-based snake with text based commands written in python.

The snake consists of a series of 1s, with a 9 indicating the head. The 0s show empty squares. Food is displayed as a 2. 
Due to the matrix used as a playing field, anything else but single-digit numbers causes the field to get misshapen.

Moving requires typing out the direction you want to go (left, right, up or down). Enter Q as input to quit.

Reach me on discord @axel_silter if you have questions.
