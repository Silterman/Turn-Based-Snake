# PythonSlowSnakeGame
Snake game (in CL) written in python without real time movement (every turn is based on player input)

The snake consists of a 9 and 1s, with the 9 representing the head. Since this game is turned based, a direction indicator is not required, but can be displayed if required since we remember the last direction we moved.
The 2 represents the apple/food.
